image::setcategories-stepone.png[]
_Figure 1: After typing `list`_

Step 2: Choose a restaurant you want to set categories to. Let us choose Astons for this example. Take note that Astons
is identified by *INDEX 1*. Start typing `setCategories 1 c/` as _follows_:

image::setcategories-steptwo.png[]
_Figure 2: Notice suggestions for cuisines will pop up. Use arrow keys to select the desired suggestion and press enter,
or you can also choose to continue typing something not in the suggestions._

Step 3: Continue keying in the occasion prefix after you finished keying in the cuisine. The occasion prefix is oc/.
Follow Figure 3 shown _below_.

image::setcategories-stepthree.png[]
_Figure 3: Once again, you can pick the occasion you see in the suggestions or continue typing._

Step 4: Key in the price range next, as demonstrated by _Figure 4 below_.

image::setcategories-stepfour.png[]
_Figure 4: Pick a price range from the list or just type, whichever is faster for you._

Step 5: Press enter and the categories will be set! Else, you might have made a typo somewhere. You should see the
following status message shown in the _Figure below_.

image::setcategories-stepfive.png[]
_Figure 5: Success!_

[NOTE]
====
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed restaurants list.
* You need to ensure that the index entered *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
* You need to ensure that the `Price Range` entered *must* only consist of 1-5 $ characters. e.g. $, \$$$, $$\$$$
is okay but $$\$$$$, cheap or $expensive will be rejected.
* You need to ensure that `Cuisine` and `Occasion` *must* only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
* You do not need to worry about capitalization. `Cuisine` and `Occasion` will be autocapitalized.
e.g. `fast food` and `premium casual` will be capitalized to
`Fast Food` and `Premium Casual`. `fAST fOOD` will be converted into `Fast Food`.
* You do not need to be concerned about the order of categories keyed in. e.g. Entering `Price Range` before `Cuisine` will
work as well.
* You do not need to set categories one by one or set all three at once. You have complete freedom to set categories
whether it is one at a time, two at a time or three at a time.
====

Other examples you can try:

* `setCategories 2 oc/Premium Casual pr/\$$$$$` +
Sets the categories of the second restaurant in the list to `Premium Casual` for occasion and
`\$$$$$` for price range.
* `setCategories 3 c/Western` +
Only sets the cuisine of the third restaurant to `Western`.

[TIP]
====
* You can make use of the autocomplete suggestions to type faster!
* When a category's prefix (`c/`, `oc/` or `pr/`) is keyed in, suggestions will appear. Use arrow keys to select the desired
suggestion and press enter. The suggestion will be filled automatically for you!
====

==== Filtering restaurants based on category : `filter`

Filters and lists the restaurants with categories matching the keywords entered. +
Format: `filter KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

*Step by step guide on how to filter:*

Step 1: Suppose you want to filter out all `Western`, `Japanese`, as well as `Chinese` restaurants. Type `filter
western japanese chinese` into the command box.

Step 2: Press enter again and now all `Western`, `Japanese` and `Chinese` restaurants will be shown.

[NOTE]
====
* You do not need to worry about case. Filtering is case insensitive. e.g. `western` will match `Western`
* You do not need to be concerned about which categories you want to filter. Filtering works across categories and also
within categories of the same type.
e.g. `japanese $` will match all restaurants with `Cuisine` set as `Japanese` or `Price Range` set as `$`.
Note this also means that the more keywords you add, the more general the filter becomes.
* You can enter keywords in any order. `$ casual` is the same as `casual $`. Both will match restaurants that has
`Price Range` as `$` or `Occasion` as `Casual`.
* You must enter words in full. e.g. `west` will not match `western`
* Restaurants matching at least one keyword will be displayed. e.g. `fast food` will match `hawker food`
====

Some examples you can try:

* `filter fine dining casual`
Returns restaurants with any category matching `fine`, `dining` or `casual`.
* `filter $ casual western`
Returns restaurants with any category matching `$`, `casual` or `western`.
