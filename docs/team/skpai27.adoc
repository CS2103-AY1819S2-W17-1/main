== PROJECT: The Food Diary

---

== Overview

The Food Diary is a desktop application that allows users to store their personal food reviews and obtain food recommendations. It is written in Java and is meant for people who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), an example being people who type rapidly. It also gives users the benefit of having a clear and interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

The Food Diary contains an extensive list of restaurants which can be searched up by users. Users can also add restaurants that are not in the application. Users can then add reviews specific to each restaurant and assign numerical ratings to each review. Following this, users can view restaurants they have previously reviewed (and visited) and categorise them according to ratings, cuisine, price etc.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *core functionality* of *adding, editing and deleting reviews*
** What it does: Allows users to add reviews specific to each restaurant, edit the reviews that have previously been added and finally to delete reviews that are no longer wanted in the application.
** Justification: This feature is essential to the purpose of the application as it is the only way for users to store their personal review entries into the application. Users are also prone to mistakes when typing or a change in opinion. Hence, the ability to edit or delete previously created reviews will prove useful.
** Highlights: Creating the 3 different commands required smooth integration with a newly created classes (Review, composed of an Entry and a Rating). Implementing this feature also required the modification of the base restaurant class.
** Credits: Reference to existing command methods was used to ensure uniformity and compatibility of the new commands with the existing application architecture and good OOP design principles.

=== Review Features

==== Adding a review: `addReview`

Adds a review to the Food Diary +
Format: `addReview INDEX re/ENTRY rr/RATING`

****

* ENTRY is a text field that include both alphabets and numbers.
* RATING is a number that has to be a value from 0-5 inclusive. It represents a score out of 5 that is assigned to the restaurant with the added review.

==== Editing a specified review : `editReview`

Edit selected fields in a specified entry. +
Format: `editReview INDEX [re/ENTRY] [rr/RATING]`

****
* Edits the review at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number of the review of the selected Restaurant. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* A restaurant must be selected with a mouse click on the desired restaurant card (see screenshots below for an illustration)
* At least one of the optional fields (either ENTRY or RATING) must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

=== Adding a Review to a selected Restaurant

==== Current Implementation
The Restaurant class contains a list of reviews. Adding a Review to a restaurant would entail adding a review to this list.

This command is handled by the `AddReviewCommand` class, which takes in an `Index` (indicating the index of the restaurant as displayed on the UI) as well as the `Review` object to be added.

An example of the correct format of this command is `addReview 1 re/Good food! rr/4`, which indicates a user trying to add a review (of entry "Good food!" and rating "4") to the first restaurant in a list.

Once this command is entered into the command line and executed, the `AddReviewCommandParser` will parse the command based on the indicated prefixes. These prefixes are pre-defined inside `Cli-Syntax`.
The parser will return an `AddReviewCommand` object, which stores the index of the restaurant to add the review too, as well as the review to be added itself. This is returned to the `Logic Manager`, which then executes the command.

The execution of this command involves:

Step 1. Retrieving the last shown list from the `Model` and retrieving the restaurant indicated by the index from the last shown list.

Step 2. Creating a new list of reviews that copies everything from the original restaurant's list of reviews.

Step 3. Inserting the new review into the list.

Step 4. Creating a new restaurant object with the new list.

Step 5. Replace the original restaurant with the new restaurant object in the model.

==== Design considerations
The primary consideration was the compatibility of this new command with the existing architecture.
Given the stable implementation of the current system of parsing commands, any new command created should fit into the existing architecture with minimal changes to other components.
