== PROJECT: The Food Diary

---

== Overview

This portfolio showcases my contributions to a software engineering team project for our software engineering module.
In a period of 6 weeks, we were tasked to implement a command line interface (CLI) based application targeted at a
specific group of users.

Our project, The Food Diary, is a fast and reliable food journal meant for nostalgic food lovers looking to document
their food adventures. Our project is written in Java and uses the JavaFX UI framework to display content onto the screen.

The main features of The Food Diary are:

* Getting personalised recommendations based on restaurants you have visited
* Documenting your food adventures and reviews in one single location so that you can easily refer back to it later
* Organising the restaurants you have visited with categories so that you can easily filter them later

My role was to implement the categorisation of restaurants as well as manage the git workflow of members.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added
to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the the following use of symbols and formatting in order to understand their meanings:

[NOTE]
====
* This is a Note, indicating crucial information. Read it to understand why something works or does not work.
====

[TIP]
====
* This is a Tip, indicating nice-to-have information. Reading these will help you navigate the application better.
====

====
* A grey highlight indicates something that you can type into the command line as an instruction. e.g. `setCategories`
* A grey highlight can also refer to specific functionalities of the application. e.g. `Cuisine`
* A *bolded* word or phrase indicates important words that you should take note of.
* A phrase in _italics_ indicates that it is either a Figure label or a phrase referring to a particular Figure.
