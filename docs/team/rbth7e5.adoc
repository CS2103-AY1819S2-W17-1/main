== PROJECT: The Food Diary

---

== Overview

This portfolio showcases my contributions for a software engineering team project for our software engineering module. In a period of 6 weeks, we were tasked to implement a command line interface (CLI) based application targeted at a specific group of users.

Our project, The Food Diary, is a fast and reliable food journal meant for nostalgic food lovers looking to document their food adventures. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLo.
