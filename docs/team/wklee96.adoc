== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

== Overview

This project portfolio page serves to document my contributions to The Food Diary, a software engineering project that was undertaken as part of the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computingâ€™s Software Engineering module.

The Food Diary is designed for food lovers whose wish to document their experiences at a restaurants in a fast and simple fashion.
It serves as a journal, allowing the users to give reviews and ratings to the restaurant that they have been to.

My role in this project is to implement a function that allows food lovers to visit the website of restaurants so that they
can reference the website while writing a review.
